# Logistic Regression

## Section 1: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

This project implements logistic regression for binary classification tasks. Logistic regression is a popular statistical method used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. In this implementation, we use two helper functions: the Sigmoid function and the Cost (Loss) function. Additionally, gradient descent algorithm is utilized to optimize the model parameters.

### Sigmoid Function

The Sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is defined as:

It maps any real-valued number to the range [0, 1]. In logistic regression, the Sigmoid function is used to transform the output of the linear combination of input features into a probability value.

### Cost (Loss) Function

The Cost function, also known as the loss function, measures the error between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels. In logistic regression, the commonly used Cost function is the binary cross-entropy loss, defined as:

The goal of logistic regression is to minimize this cost function by adjusting the model parameters.

### Gradient Descent Algorithm

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the Cost function by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost gradient. In logistic regression, gradient descent is employed to find the optimal values for the coefficients of the linear model.

## Iris Dataset Example

To demonstrate logistic regression from scratch, we utilize the Iris dataset (`Iris.csv`). The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers and their corresponding species. We perform binary classification by considering only two classes: Setosa and Versicolor.

### Implementation Details

1. Load the Iris dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Implement logistic regression using Python and NumPy.
3. Train the logistic regression model using gradient descent.
4. Make predictions on the test data.
5. Plot the decision boundary to visualize the classification results.
